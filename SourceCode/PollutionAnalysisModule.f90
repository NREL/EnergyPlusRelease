          !       AUTHOR         Richard J. Liesen (RJL)
          !       DATE WRITTEN   August 2002
          !       MODIFIED       January 17, 2004 - J Glazer - Added source energy support including schedules for source energy
          !                      January 2008 - L Lawrie - implementing schedule fields for all emission factors.
          !       RE-ENGINEERED  December 2003 RJL

          ! PURPOSE OF THIS MODULE:
          ! To encapsulate the data and algorithms required to
          ! calculate the pollution, and carbon eqiuvalent for the Energy consumed

          ! METHODOLOGY EMPLOYED:
          ! The methodology employed is to calculate the
          ! source pollution from building energy consumption.
          !    PURPOSE:= Takes the Energy from the various sources and
          !               calculates the Environmental Impact Factors.
          !         STEP 1:  We begin with the output expressing the energy
          !
          !         STEP 2:  The energy used by types: must be converted back
          !         to source fuel types (fossil or electricity) via User Input.
          !
          !         STEP 3:  All energy numbers have been converted to units of MJ's or 1x10^6 Joules.
          !
          !         STEP 4:  Environmental Impact Factors are calculated from Coefficients
