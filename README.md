# EnergyPlusRelease

This repository is a public static repository holding older, FORTRAN, versions of EnergyPlus.  This is a portal for people who might want to access the source, but also a convenient place to drop all the old installers from version 7.0 to 8.1.

* For access to the open source C++ code, iteration builds, and other developer information, please see our main GitHub repo at https://github.com/NREL/EnergyPlus
