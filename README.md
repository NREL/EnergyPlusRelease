EnergyPlusRelease
=================

This repository is an **interim** storage location for EnergyPlus.  It will act as the open source entry into EnergyPlus source code and also as the place to find installer packages.

EnergyPlus source code is being actively developed on GitHub, though it is currently in a private repository.  The development team is actively preparing that repository for the fully public open source transition.

Once the active development repository is opened, this repository will no longer be needed.  The source code, build scripts and utilities, and installers will all be available in one central location.

For more information about EnergyPlus, including how to download older versions, please see [the United States Department of Energy's EnergyPlus website](http://www.energyplus.gov.)
