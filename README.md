# EnergyPlusRelease

This repository is a public static repository holding older, FORTRAN, versions of EnergyPlus.  This is a portal for people who might want to access the source, but also a convenient place to drop all the old installers from version 7.0 to 8.1.

> Windows packages for EnergyPlus 8.6.0 and prior had a vulnerability in the View3D binary that could expose users to a stack-based buffer overflow.  Because of this, all Windows packages 8.6.0 and older have been purged and are no longer available.  We apologize for any inconvenience.
